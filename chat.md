Review <github>, observe whats else needed to work. Please ensure that these additional items needed to change:

1. executable when creating keygen will also create mnemonic and then from the path 1337/0/0 for example to create eddsa address for example to sign.

2. Remember that there is MPC custody that will issue and redeem wrapped bitcoin, and receive the fees for this, explain how this is to be done in the instructions.

3. ensure that the MPC custody can get the fee reservoir from minting, transfer, burn new asset. Also the mpc custody can move all the fees to a certain address and move it.

4. produce an "executable" that could assist users and MPC custody to use the system. Write clear and easy instructions to use.

5. Remember that not everyone will be part of this MPC custody, only the core developers, can operate this MPC custody.

Now write <instructions> so that the developers are aware. You can list task list so that he can update the task list.
