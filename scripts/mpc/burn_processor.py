MPC Burn Processor for 0BTC Wire

This script demonstrates how MPC operators would:
1. Monitor the L1/DA layer for burn proofs
2. Verify the proofs and extract withdrawal information
3. Process BTC withdrawals to the specified addresses

Note: This is a reference implementation. In production, this would be
implemented as a secure, distributed service with proper key management.
