# 0BTC Wire Audit Readiness Checklist

## Introduction
This document outlines the necessary steps to prepare the 0BTC Wire project for an external security audit. The checklist ensures that all components are properly documented, tested, and ready for review by external auditors.

## Code Quality and Documentation

### Source Code
- [ ] All code is properly commented with clear explanations of complex logic
- [ ] Function and variable names are descriptive and follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Unused code, debug statements, and TODOs have been removed or clearly marked
- [ ] Code complexity is minimized where possible, with complex functions broken down into smaller, testable units
- [ ] All compiler warnings have been addressed

### Documentation
- [ ] Architecture documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] API documentation covers all public interfaces
- [ ] Security model and threat model documentation is complete
- [ ] Known limitations and edge cases are documented
- [ ] Integration guides include security best practices
- [ ] Cryptographic assumptions and primitives are clearly documented

## Testing and Verification

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests cover all core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are explicitly tested
- [ ] Test coverage metrics meet or exceed 90% for critical components
- [ ] All tests pass consistently in the CI/CD pipeline

### Fuzz Testing
- [ ] Fuzz testing has been implemented for all user-facing interfaces
- [ ] Fuzz testing has been implemented for cryptographic operations
- [ ] Identified issues from fuzzing have been addressed
- [ ] Fuzzing coverage metrics are documented

### Benchmarking
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are documented for all critical operations
- [ ] Resource usage (memory, CPU) is documented for various workloads
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks have been identified and addressed

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Input validation is performed at all trust boundaries
- [ ] Error messages do not leak sensitive information

### Cryptographic Implementation
- [ ] All cryptographic operations use well-reviewed libraries or have been extensively reviewed
- [ ] No custom cryptographic primitives are used without thorough review
- [ ] Domain separation is properly implemented for all hash operations
- [ ] Randomness sources are cryptographically secure
- [ ] Key management procedures are documented and secure

### Zero-Knowledge Proof System
- [ ] Circuit constraints are comprehensive and correctly implemented
- [ ] Public inputs and private inputs are correctly separated
- [ ] Proof generation and verification are correctly implemented
- [ ] Recursive proof aggregation is correctly implemented
- [ ] Circuit optimizations do not compromise security properties

### Error Handling
- [ ] Error handling is consistent across the codebase
- [ ] Critical operations fail securely (fail-closed rather than fail-open)
- [ ] Error propagation does not leak sensitive information
- [ ] Resource cleanup is properly handled in error cases

## Audit Materials

### Test Vectors
- [ ] Test vectors cover all critical operations
- [ ] Test vectors include both valid and invalid inputs
- [ ] Test vectors include edge cases
- [ ] Test vectors are documented and reproducible

### Audit Scope
- [ ] Audit scope document clearly defines what is in and out of scope
- [ ] Critical components are prioritized for review
- [ ] Dependencies and their security implications are documented
- [ ] Previous audit findings and their resolutions are documented

### Security Properties
- [ ] Security properties and invariants are clearly documented
- [ ] Formal or informal proofs of security properties are provided where applicable
- [ ] Trust assumptions are clearly documented
- [ ] Threat model is comprehensive and up-to-date

## Operational Security

### Deployment
- [ ] Deployment procedures are documented and secure
- [ ] Configuration management is documented
- [ ] Secure defaults are provided for all configurable options
- [ ] Upgrade and migration procedures are documented

### Incident Response
- [ ] Incident response procedures are documented
- [ ] Contact information for security issues is provided
- [ ] Vulnerability disclosure policy is documented
- [ ] Process for addressing security issues is defined

## Final Checklist

- [ ] All "TODO" items in the codebase have been addressed
- [ ] All known issues are documented with mitigation strategies
- [ ] All dependencies are up-to-date with no known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code freeze is in place for the audit period
- [ ] Team members are available to respond to auditor questions
- [ ] Audit timeline and expectations are clearly communicated

## Post-Audit Plan

- [ ] Process for addressing audit findings is defined
- [ ] Prioritization criteria for addressing findings are established
- [ ] Verification process for remediated findings is defined
- [ ] Timeline for addressing findings is established
- [ ] Communication plan for audit results is defined
