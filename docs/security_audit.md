## Critical Components

### EdDSA Signature Verification

The EdDSA signature verification is a critical component of the 0BTC Wire project, as it ensures that only authorized users can spend UTXOs. The implementation must correctly verify signatures according to the EdDSA specification.

Key security properties:
- Signature verification must be complete and sound
- No shortcuts or optimizations should compromise security
- The implementation should be resistant to side-channel attacks

### Poseidon Hash Function

The Poseidon hash function is used for various purposes, including UTXO commitment, nullifier generation, and Merkle tree construction. The implementation must provide the security properties expected of a cryptographic hash function.

Key security properties:
- Collision resistance
- Preimage resistance
- Second preimage resistance
- No optimizations should compromise these properties

### Merkle Proof Verification

Merkle proof verification is used to prove inclusion of UTXOs in the state tree. The implementation must correctly verify Merkle proofs according to the Merkle tree specification.

Key security properties:
- Proof verification must be complete and sound
- No shortcuts or optimizations should compromise security
- The implementation should handle edge cases correctly

### Nullifier Generation

Nullifier generation is used to prevent double-spending of UTXOs. The implementation must ensure that nullifiers are unique for each UTXO and cannot be forged.

Key security properties:
- Nullifiers must be unique for each UTXO
- Nullifiers must be deterministic
- Nullifiers must be unpredictable without knowledge of the private key

## Known Attack Vectors

### Double-Spending Attacks

Double-spending attacks involve spending the same UTXO multiple times. The 0BTC Wire project prevents this through nullifiers, which are published when a UTXO is spent. The nullifier generation and verification logic must be secure to prevent double-spending.

Mitigation:
- Ensure nullifiers are correctly generated and verified
- Verify that nullifiers are properly recorded and checked

### Signature Forgery Attacks

Signature forgery attacks involve creating valid signatures without knowledge of the private key. The EdDSA signature verification logic must be secure to prevent signature forgery.

Mitigation:
- Ensure signature verification is implemented correctly
- Verify that no shortcuts or optimizations compromise security

### Invalid Proof Attacks

Invalid proof attacks involve creating proofs that verify successfully but do not satisfy the circuit constraints. The proof verification logic must be secure to prevent invalid proof attacks.

Mitigation:
- Ensure all constraints are properly enforced
- Verify that the proof verification logic is complete and sound

### Front-Running Attacks

Front-running attacks involve observing pending transactions and submitting competing transactions with higher fees. While this is primarily a concern for the blockchain layer, the 0BTC Wire project should be designed to minimize the impact of front-running.

Mitigation:
- Consider implementing commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations
- Document front-running risks and mitigation strategies

## Security Properties

The 0BTC Wire project should provide the following security properties:

1. **Confidentiality**: The contents of UTXOs should be confidential, with only the owner able to reveal the details.
2. **Integrity**: The state of the system should be protected from unauthorized modifications.
3. **Availability**: The system should be available for legitimate users to create and verify proofs.
4. **Authentication**: Only authorized users should be able to spend UTXOs.
5. **Non-repudiation**: Users should not be able to deny having spent UTXOs.
6. **Unlinkability**: It should be difficult to link different transactions to the same user.
7. **Forward secrecy**: Compromise of a private key should not reveal information about past transactions.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Initial Findings (2025-04-30)

#### EdDSA Signature Verification

1. **Implementation Correctness**: 
   - The EdDSA signature verification implementation correctly follows the standard algorithm
   - All required steps are properly implemented: curve point validation, hash computation, and equation verification
   - Special cases (identity point, small scalar values) are handled correctly in scalar multiplication

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The `is_on_curve` function returns a Target (0 or 1) rather than constraining the point to be on the curve
   - The batch verification uses a simplified approach for generating random weights, which could potentially be predictable
   - The implementation assumes that the inputs are properly validated before being passed to the verification function

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Modify `is_on_curve` to use `builder.assert_is_equal` to enforce the constraint rather than returning a Target
   - Improve the randomness source for batch verification weights to use a more secure method
   - Add explicit input validation for signature components

#### Poseidon Hash Function

1. **Implementation Correctness**:
   - The hash implementation correctly uses Plonky2's built-in Poseidon hash function
   - Optimized versions for different input sizes are provided to reduce constraint count
   - The UTXO hashing approach is hierarchical and efficient

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Multiple hash implementations (original, optimized, specialized) could lead to inconsistencies
   - Empty input handling returns a constant value (0), which might not be ideal for security
   - The optimized implementations might have different security properties than the standard ones

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Standardize on a single hash implementation with optimizations under the hood
   - Use a more secure approach for empty input handling (e.g., hash a fixed non-zero value)
   - Document the security assumptions and properties of each hash implementation

#### Nullifier Generation

1. **Implementation Correctness**:
   - The nullifier calculation correctly combines salt and owner's secret key
   - The nullifier is properly registered as a public input
   - The implementation is simple and straightforward

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The nullifier calculation uses the owner's secret key directly, which could potentially leak information
   - There is no domain separation between different hash usages
   - The nullifier is deterministic, which could potentially be used for tracking

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Consider using a derived key for nullifier generation rather than the owner's secret key directly
   - Add domain separation to the hash function (e.g., prefix with a context string)
   - Consider adding randomness to the nullifier generation process to improve privacy

#### Transfer Circuit

1. **Implementation Correctness**:
   - The circuit correctly verifies ownership of input UTXOs through signature verification
   - Conservation of value is properly enforced (input_sum >= output_sum)
   - Fee payment is properly enforced through the enforce_fee_payment gadget
   - Nullifiers are calculated and registered for all input UTXOs

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The message signed by the sender includes recipient details, output amounts, asset ID, and a nonce, but does not include the fee amount or fee reservoir address
   - The nonce is a virtual target without explicit randomness requirements
   - The circuit assumes all input UTXOs have the same asset ID without explicit verification

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Include fee amount and fee reservoir address in the signed message
   - Add explicit randomness requirements for the nonce
   - Add explicit verification that all input UTXOs have the same asset ID

#### Wrapped Asset Mint Circuit

1. **Implementation Correctness**:
   - The circuit correctly verifies the custodian's signature on the attestation
   - The attestation includes recipient public key hash, amount, and deposit nonce
   - The output UTXO is created with the correct owner, asset ID, and amount

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The deposit nonce is used to prevent replay attacks but there's no mechanism to track used nonces
   - There's no validation that the custodian's public key is authorized
   - The circuit doesn't enforce any limits on the mint amount

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Implement a mechanism to track and validate used nonces
   - Add a registry of authorized custodian public keys
   - Consider adding mint amount limits based on business requirements

#### Recursive Proof Aggregation

   - Proof structure verification is implemented before processing

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The `verify_proof_structure` function checks structure but not semantic validity

   - Error messages may leak sensitive information

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Review and enhance random number generation for browser contexts
   - Complete input validation for all WASM functions
   - Sanitize error messages to prevent information leakage

#### Merkle Proof Verification

   - The Merkle proof verification implementation correctly computes the path from leaf to root
   - The implementation uses an optimized approach with select operations instead of conditional logic
   - The implementation properly checks if the computed root matches the expected root

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - The verification returns a Target (0 or 1) rather than asserting the root equality
   - There's no validation of the tree height or proof structure
