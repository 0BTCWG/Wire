## Known Issues

1. **Plonky2 Compatibility**: The current implementation uses Plonky2 v0.2.x, which requires updates to the circuit implementations to be fully compatible.
2. **Stubbed Proof Generation**: The current implementation uses stubbed proof generation and verification for some circuits. Real ZK proof implementation needs to be added.
3. **Partial Optimization**: While key cryptographic gadgets (Merkle proof, EdDSA signature, Poseidon hash) have been optimized, other parts of the circuits may still need optimization.
4. **Completed**: All cryptographic gadgets now use real implementations rather than simplified stubs.
5. **Completed**: Major cryptographic operations have been optimized for constraint count.
6. Documentation needs to be expanded with more detailed examples
