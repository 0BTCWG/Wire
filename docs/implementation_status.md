## To Do

### Documentation
- â¬œ Add detailed API documentation
- â¬œ Create user guides for CLI and WASM usage
- â¬œ Performance benchmarking
- â¬œ CI/CD setup
- â¬œ Security audits
- â¬œ Integration with external systems

### CI/CD
- â¬œ Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- â¬œ Add code coverage reporting
- â¬œ Implement automated builds for releases

## Known Issues

1. **Plonky2 Compatibility**: The current implementation uses Plonky2 v0.2.x, which requires updates to the circuit implementations to be fully compatible.
2. **Stubbed Proof Generation**: The current implementation uses stubbed proof generation and verification for some circuits. Real ZK proof implementation needs to be added.
3. **Optimization**: The circuits have not been optimized for constraint count and performance.
4. Some gadgets are currently using simplified implementations (e.g., Ed25519 verification)
5. Circuit constraint count needs optimization
6. Documentation needs to be expanded with more detailed examples

## Next Steps

1. Optimize circuits to reduce constraint count
2. Add comprehensive API documentation
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building
4. Conduct performance benchmarking
